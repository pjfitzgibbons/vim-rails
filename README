rails.vim

== Ruby-enabled VIM for Mac OSX Snow Leopard (10.6 +) ==

This vim configuration requires a ruby-enabled VIM, to support the CommandT plugin.

You can get a well-honed and fully-enabled VIM from :

http://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads

Follow Björn Winckler's Installation instructions for best results.

=== Link MacVim into 'vim' command line ==

The 'mvim' command within Björn's repo is a self-recognizing bash script.

When named 'mvim','gvim', etc, it will launch the MacVim GUI.
When named 'vim', it will launch text-mode VIM in the terminal.

You may link/copy the 'mvim' into whatever locations may be convenient for you.

Make sure to 'vim --version' and check that your $PATH is catching the right VIM.


== Installation ==
You are welcome do install this any number of ways.  Here is a recommendation :

Move or Re-move your existing ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc

Clone this Git repo into a convenient location (say, ~/vim-rails) :

  cd ~
  git clone git@github.com:pjfitzgibbons/vim-rails.git

Link the repo into the expected locations for VIM :

  ln -s ~/vim-rails ~/.vim
  ln -s ~/vim-rails/.vimrc ~/.vimrc


To install, simply copy autoload/rails.vim, plugin/rails.vim, and
doc/rails.txt to the appropriate directories in ~/.vim.  Alternatively,
`rake install` may be used.

See doc/rails.txt for documentation.
